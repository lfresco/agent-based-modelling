# Agent-Based Models Repository

Welcome to the Agent-Based Models repository! This repository contains implementations of various agent-based models, starting with Epstein's models for social conflicts and expanding to cover a wide range of commonly used agent-based models.

## Epstein's Models for Social Conflicts

1. **Schelling's Model of Segregation**: Implementation of Thomas Schelling's model demonstrating how simple individual preferences can lead to segregation in a population.

2. **Ethnocentrism Model**: Implementation of Epstein's model exploring the emergence of ethnocentrism within a society.

3. **A Model of Civil Violence**: Implementation of Epstein's model studying the spread and containment of civil violence within a society.

4. **SugarScape**: Implementation of the SugarScape model exploring how agents gather and use resources within a dynamic environment.

## Other Agent-Based Models

1. **Conway's Game of Life**: Classic cellular automaton devised by John Conway, demonstrating emergent complexity from simple rules.

2. **Boids**: Implementation of Craig Reynolds' boids algorithm simulating the flocking behavior of birds.

3. **Ant Colony Optimization**: Implementation of ant colony optimization algorithms for solving optimization problems.

## Contributing
